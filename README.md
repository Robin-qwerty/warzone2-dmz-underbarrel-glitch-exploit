# Call of Duty: Warzone Underbarrel Glitch Exploit

## Overview
This project demonstrates the exploit in Call of Duty: Warzone 2 that exploits a glitch related to the underbarrel attachments. The glitch provides players with infinite underbarrel ammo and a really fast shooting speed.

## What You Need
To replicate this glitch, you'll need the following:
- Need to have python installed to run the script.
- A throwing knife or any tactical equipment that can be thrown.
- A gun with a underbarrel attachment, such as a grenade launcher or shotgun, but with some weapons this will also work, like the broadside or RGL.

## How It Works
This project includes a Python script (`automate_sequence.py`) that simulates the execution of the underbarrel glitch exploit. You need to run this script in a terminal while playing Call of Duty: Warzone. The script listens for middle mouse button clicks/pressing the scrollwheel down. Every time you click the middle mouse button/press the scrollwheel down, it will trigger the sequence, effectively simulating the underbarrel glitch by shooting the underbarrel really fast while using no ammo.

### A picture I found online that shows how the exploit works:

## Usage
Here is how you can use this script yourself:
1. Download this repository and open the file location in a terminal like cmd or Windows PowerShell.
2. Have python and pip installed and run `pip install --user -r requirements.txt` to install all the requirements for the script.
3. Run the script by doing `python automate_sequence.py` in a terminal.
4. Play the game: Call of Duty - Warzone 2.
5. Press the `Del` button to activate/deactivate the script, you wil see in the command line when the script is active.
6. Whenever you want to execute the glitch, click the middle mouse button/press the scrollwheel down.
