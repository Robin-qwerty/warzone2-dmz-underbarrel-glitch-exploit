# Call of Duty: Warzone Underbarrel Glitch Exploit

## Overview
This project demonstrates the exploit in Call of Duty: Warzone 2 that exploits a glitch related to the underbarrel attachments. The glitch provides players with infinite underbarrel ammo and a really fast shooting speed.

## What You Need
To replicate this glitch, you'll need the following:
- A throwing knife or any tactical equipment that can be thrown
- A gun with a underbarrel attachment, such as a grenade launcher or shotgun, but with some wapons this wil also work, like the broadside or RGL.

## How It Works
This project includes a Python script (`automate_sequence.py`) that simulates the execution of the underbarrel glitch exploit. You need to run this script in a terminal while playing Call of Duty: Warzone. The script listens for middle mouse button clicks/pressing the scrollwheel down. Every time you click the middle mouse button/pressing the scrollwheel down, it will trigger the sequence, effectively simulating the underbarrel glitch by shooting the underbarrel realy fast while useing no ammo.

### A picture I found online that shows how the exploit works and what the script does:

## Usage
1. Run the script `automate_sequence.py` in a terminal.
2. Play the game: Call of Duty - Warzone 2.
3. Whenever you want to execute the glitch, click the middle mouse button/press the scrollwheel down.
